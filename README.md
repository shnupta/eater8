A small emulation of Ben Eater's 8-bit computer

[Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0N5baNlQWJCUrhCEo8WlA) on YouTube has built his own 8-bit CPU on a breadboard.
I've only watched a couple videos so far but it seems super cool and definitely something I would like to try out in the future but for now, I decided to write a small emulator for it.

It currently only runs the program that Ben shows in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PPrrSyubG0) which is just adding two numbers together.
